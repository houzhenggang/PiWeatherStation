Dependences

PiWeaterStation records the readings from BMP085 sensor in SQlite3 database.                                        
It depends on the following libraries:
- libBMP085 library  for communication with the BMP085 sensor from user space;     
- libconfig (http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/) is used for parsing the PiWeatherStation configuration file. For the syntax
  and formating of the configuration file, check the libconfig web site;
- librt to implement the sampling interval timer;
- libsqlite3-dev for recording the collected data in SQLLite3 db.

All of those libraries must be present before building the PiWeaterStation executable.


Installation

1. To compile the source code execute the following command from the source directory:

   #gcc -o PiWeatherStation main.c configurator.c db.c -lbmp085 -lrt -lsqlite3 -lconfig

2. Copy the created executable together with the conf and db folder to the target folder.
